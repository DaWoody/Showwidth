Showwidth
=========

A small jQuery script file I made to help front-end developers find out their browsers width while developing responsive design.

How it works: 

By including the code in a .js file the browser will, if resized, launch a pop-up window that displays the width of the browser.

The code is open source etc. So share and care :) 
If you have any ideas on how to make this plugin better or want to join me making the code better, please feel free to do so! :)

Otherwise you can follow me on GitHub (https://github.com/DaWoody) or on BitBucket (https://bitbucket.com/DaWoody). Or you can listen to my musical endevours here: http://www.woodfieldtheartist.net.

Cheers!
